# Git Pushing Skill

Handle git operations with conventional commit messages, following the KanbAgent project standards.

## When to Use

- User says "push", "commit", "save to git/github/remote"
- After completing a feature or bugfix
- User says "ship it", "let's save this work", "commit that"

## Process

### 1. Assess What Changed
```bash
git status
git diff --stat
```

### 2. Group Changes Logically
If changes span multiple concerns, split into separate commits:
- DB schema changes → separate commit
- UI changes → separate commit  
- IPC/main process → separate commit
- Config/tooling → separate commit

### 3. Conventional Commit Format
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: new feature
- `fix`: bug fix
- `refactor`: code change without feature/fix
- `style`: formatting, no logic change
- `test`: adding/fixing tests
- `docs`: documentation
- `chore`: build, config, deps
- `perf`: performance improvement

**Scopes for KanbAgent:**
- `kanban`: Kanban board UI
- `agents`: agent orchestration logic
- `db`: SQLite schema or queries
- `ipc`: Electron IPC channels
- `ui`: general UI components
- `electron`: main process
- `store`: Pinia stores

**Examples:**
```
feat(kanban): add drag-and-drop between columns
fix(db): correct agent status migration on startup
refactor(ipc): type all channel names as const enum
chore(deps): upgrade electron to v32
```

### 4. Execute
```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "<conventional message>"
git push origin <current-branch>
```

### 5. Confirm
Report what was committed and pushed, with the commit hash.

## Rules
- Never `git add .` blindly — always review `git status` first
- Never force push to `main`
- If on `main` with unreviewed changes, suggest creating a branch first
- If tests exist, remind user to run them before pushing
