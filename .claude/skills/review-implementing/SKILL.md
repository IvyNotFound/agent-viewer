# Review Implementing Skill

Systematically process and implement code review feedback, including output from Claude Code review agents.

## When to Use

- User pastes PR/code review comments
- User shares output from a review agent (e.g. agent role `review` or `security`)
- User says "implement this feedback", "address these comments", "apply review notes"
- After a `review` or `security` agent run in the multi-agent workflow

## Process

### 1. Parse the Feedback
Extract all actionable items from the review. Categorize as:
- 🔴 **Critical**: bugs, security issues, broken logic → fix immediately
- 🟡 **Important**: performance, type safety, architecture concerns → fix in this pass
- 🟢 **Minor**: style, naming, docs → fix if quick, otherwise defer
- 💬 **Discussion**: questions or suggestions needing decision → flag for user

### 2. Create a Todo List
```
## Review Implementation Plan

### Critical
- [ ] [description] — [file:line]

### Important  
- [ ] [description] — [file:line]

### Minor
- [ ] [description] — [file:line]

### Deferred / Discussion
- [ ] [description] — reason
```

Present this list to user before implementing. Confirm scope.

### 3. Implement Systematically
- Work through Critical → Important → Minor in order
- After each fix, mark as done in the todo list
- Keep fixes focused: don't refactor unrelated code while fixing review items

### 4. Validate
After all fixes:
- Run TypeScript compiler: `tsc --noEmit`
- Run tests if available
- Quick sanity check on affected components

### 5. Report
Summary of what was implemented, what was deferred, and why.

## Special Cases for KanbAgent

### When feedback comes from a `security` agent:
- Treat all security findings as Critical regardless of severity label
- Check IPC input validation (never trust renderer input in main process)
- Check SQLite queries for injection risks (use parameterized queries)

### When feedback comes from a `review` agent:
- Pay special attention to TypeScript type coverage comments
- Check for Vue 3 reactivity pitfalls flagged (`.value` misuse, toRef vs toRefs)
- Verify IPC channel type consistency between main and renderer

### When feedback comes from a `rd` (R&D) agent:
- These are suggestions/experiments, not mandatory
- Flag each one as a potential ticket in KanbAgent itself
