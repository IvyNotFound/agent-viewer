 *    in 'done' for more than 1 minute (done AFTER the session started) AND no

 * 2. Manually-closed: find sessions that transitioned to 'completed' since last poll
 *    (covers agents with no assigned tasks, e.g. review, doc).

 * Uses agent_id FK instead of summary LIKE (which matched nothing on active sessions).
